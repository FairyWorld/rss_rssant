								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Welcome to <a href="https://www.manrepeller.com/set/outfit-anatomy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Outfit Anatomy</a>, a series of comprehensive style analyses that aim to break down the mechanics of why we wear what we wear. Up this week is author and activist, Jodie Patterson.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>When I was getting dressed for this story last month, I wanted to be comfortable. I had to take the subway from Brooklyn to your office in Soho and it was raining. I’d been on a few Human Rights Campaign board calls that morning and I did a dress rehearsal for a stage performance I was in called <a href="https://www.theatermania.com/shows/new-york-city-theater/off-broadway/in-love-and-struggle_333700" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In Love and Struggle</a>.</p>
<p>Mostly I wanted to be strong. I was conjuring masculine and feminine vibes—figure old-world glamour with rude-boy confidence. But that day feels like a million minutes ago. I know the routine well, I’ve done it so many times—running from here-to-there, work-to-kids-to-work again, the A-train to the city and back to Brooklyn. And even though it was last month, it feels far enough away that I can’t exactly taste it anymore.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-206879 size-full alignright" src="https://www.manrepeller.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/20040_Outfit-Anatomy_Jodie_1.jpg" alt="" width="1400" height="2100" /></p>
<p>I know this is hard to say and to hear, especially because I know people who haven’t survived this pandemic—I am one of the lucky few who have—but I respect this time. There is so much loss. And I feel the loss. Yet I can see how something like this was a long time coming. The earth is a living, breathing thing and we haven’t really respected that. Now the earth is saying: stop, think about what you’ve done and come back with a new plan of action. I’m trying to take a step back to think about my actions.</p>
<p>Before I got sick with the virus, I was on four planes, a bus, a train, and three stages—not including three televised appearances. So much of that modus operandi is now under question—should anyone really travel that much? How many things do we really have to do in a single day? It now seems to me unnatural and unsafe. I’m trying to rethink the way I’ll work going forward.</p>
<p>I got sick in Vegas. I arrived there on March 3rd for work but by March 5th, I couldn&#8217;t get out of bed. My symptoms where a migraine, body pains, and chills darting down my back. I could barely walk down the stairs at my hotel to get in a cab to go to the hospital, but I made it to one on the 5th and tested positive for COVID-19 there. They quarantined me in the hospital for two weeks and in those weeks, I was relocated twice to two separate hospitals.</p>
<p>Even after my symptoms subsided, I couldn&#8217;t (and wouldn&#8217;t) travel home. It was hard to not have family around. I relied on one caring nurse who reminded me that it only takes one person to extend a hand and to act humanely—to shift a situation from bad (but still not the worst) to better.</p>
<hr />
<p>I bet we’re all rethinking things. The term “superpower&#8221; has been on my mind lately. What does it really mean? What makes us strong? I keep asking myself: Are our systems—those for our families, our businesses, our country—strong enough to withstand COVID-19 or any “virus” for that matter?</p>
<p>And then there’s this big breakthrough, right? We’re debunking the myth that real work happens in an office. But now, we’re seeing it happen whenever and wherever dedicated people are. Period. Activism is real work. Our nurses, mail deliverers, food suppliers, and grocery story folks—they’re the heroes of today. They’re keeping hope alive.</p>
<hr />
<p>My jacket is by <a href="https://rstyle.me/+jMoDFuCEpsWdYL8wbCV9Zg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zac Posen</a>. It’s hand-embroidered—he gave it to me when I was his director of PR over 10 years ago. It was way out of my budget, maybe a thousand dollars. I can’t recall.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-206880 size-full" src="https://www.manrepeller.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/20040_Outfit-Anatomy_Jodie_3.jpg" alt="" width="1903" height="1400" /></p>
<p>The pants are from my favorite shop, <a href="https://no6store.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">No. 6 Store</a>. I bought them because they make me look really tall. There is no zipper, they pull on and pull off. They’re also oversized and have good form so I feel larger than life in them. I’m pretty sure the shop is closed right now, but have been thinking about ways to support my favorite small brands from a distance.</p>
<p>The hat was hand-knitted in 2001 by an old friend and phenomenal singer, Martin Luther. I love that it’s gray. It’s like a neutral slate that complements any mood or outfit. The color equivalent of jeans. And the knit makes the hat flexible so it works with any of my hairstyles.</p>
<p>Martin and I basically grew up together during college. He was at Morehouse and I was at Spelman. He made one of the hats for me and one for my daughter—my first of my five children, who was two at the time.</p>
<p>I’ve had it through 18 homes, nine careers, two marriages, five children and tons of friendships. It’s legendary and loyal. It feels right every time I put it on. It also has a way of making me feel young-at-heart and down-for-whatever. Which is exactly how I want to be right now. Don’t we all?<img class="wp-image-206884 size-full alignleft" src="https://www.manrepeller.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/20040_Outfit-Anatomy_Jodie_4copy.jpg" alt="" width="1400" height="2100" /></p>
<p>The world is always heavy but especially right now. I’m proud to be an anchor for my family, community, and business and am called more specifically to stand in this role in these days, but honestly, some days, I just want to fly up and over it all. Young people, I find, can fly over stuff more seamlessly because they’re not as defined by stuff yet.</p>
<p>But it’s not binary. On other days, I want to &#8220;starfish&#8221; as I call it—stretch out and touch the world.</p>
<p>And then on a day like today, in the wake of the outbreak, being “down for whatever” takes on a different meaning. I’ve been asking myself: Are you down for what this moment takes? Can you mother your kids and still be present from miles apart?</p>
<p>My three young boys (ages 14, 12, 11) are out of the city with their dad. (They usually go between my house and dad’s house but under the current circumstance I haven’t seen them in over a month.) My daughter, who is 28, lives in Switzerland, in Zurich, on her own. It seems I won’t see her for until after the summer—and my oldest son (he&#8217;s 20) lives on his own in Brooklyn. We speak very often.</p>
<p>I stay up at night thinking: If it comes down to it, how do I make my way back to my kids? How do we gather back together as a family and stay together? Are you warrior enough, Jodie, to make it back? If shit ticked up to the next level, could I handle it?</p>
<p>I think to really handle what’s ahead of us, we’ll need to combine wisdom and a sort of naive, young-at-heart fearlessness.</p>
<hr />
<p>18 homes is a lot, I know. I like movement. I like change. I like design. But I guess the bigger truth is that I myself am constantly in motion, or at least used to be, and seem to use moving to refresh myself and let major shifts take place every few years.</p>
<p>As far as my careers, well, I’m a co-owner of Joe&#8217;s Pub. I worked closely with my ex-husband, Serge Becker, the brain behind the pub to bring on live performers like Alicia Keys, Max Roach, and Quest Love and DJs like Mark Ronson. That was 20 years ago.<img class="wp-image-206895 size-full alignright" src="https://www.manrepeller.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/20040_Outfit-Anatomy_Jodie_9-copy.jpg" alt="" width="1400" height="2100" /></p>
<p>I was the Fashion Director of sales at VIBE (I was horrible at that!). And I ran my own PR firm for years. We had clients like Nike, Lincoln Center, and Cedella Marley. Now I call myself a writer—I have a memoir out called <a href="https://amzn.to/3dRdxoP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>A Bold World</em></a> and one coming out soon called <em>Think Like a Mother: The Architect of Parenting</em>—and social activist. Most of the work I do is around LGBTQ awareness and protection.</p>
<p>My eyes are pretty naturally seeing the injustices. The divisions in America and in the world have been clear to me, but I think they’re becoming even more clear—the lines drawn between races and economic groups are deeper than ever. I hear a lot of people saying that COVID-19 doesn’t discriminate and it’s true that the virus doesn’t, but which communities will rise or fall as a result of this? We do have the power to collectively and quickly rewrite the story of The Other and frame it as “We.” I really believe that.</p>
<hr />
<p>In quarantine, I’ve been FaceTiming with my kids and the HRC board members—my extended family—to keep me sane. I’ve been cooking, cleaning, writing, stretching, and running to stay grounded, and I’ve been listening to music, trimming my puppy, and thinking about the day I’ll get dressed again to keep me smiling.</p>
<p>Everything I wear reminds me of people. My hat reminds me of Martin (and honestly, Bob Marley too). My jacket reminds me of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/zacposen/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zac Posen</a>. My pants remind me of my father, my uncle and my grandfather—all the gentlemen who came up around the turn of the century through the mid-1900s in Harlem and down south.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-206894 size-full" src="https://www.manrepeller.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/20040_Outfit-Anatomy_Jodie_8.jpg" alt="" width="1903" height="1400" /></p>
<p>And let me tell you, the men in my family were revolutionaries! My dad opened the first black brokerage firm on Wall Street. My uncle was the singer Gil Scott Heron who wrote &#8220;The Revolution Won’t Be Televised.&#8221; My grandfather was their dad. To listen to them speak on economics, politics, and family dynamics was mesmerizing. And they all happened to be very handsome.</p>
<p>I haven’t really been thinking about shopping since the coronavirus outbreak. Not toilet paper, not bags of rice I don’t need. I’m not consuming much at all—just what I need. I’ve been thinking mostly about health, togetherness, soulful music, and maintaining stability. But once in a while, when I’m feeling light, I’ve popped on my favorite fashion and travel sites (<a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Architectural Digest</a>, <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nat Geo Traveler</a>, <a href="https://rstyle.me/+HBxqDiEdq81Mycyrq_3csQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clare V.</a>, <a href="https://no6store.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">No. 6.</a>,) and daydreamed about ‘tomorrow.&#8217; The places to which I’ll travel and the things I will wear to go see those places.</p>
<hr />
<p>After coming home from Las Vegas, I took a week at home to be still. I moved from room to room in my house but didn’t interact with the outside world. During that time and even still now, I try to be intentional about what I put on, how I care for my skin, my hair, what goes in my mouth. What I listen to and what I read. I’m going to be home for a long time, like so many of us, but still, I dress. I don’t have to. None of us do, but it reminds me that “the day has begun.” In some way it reminds me that even in the wake of loss and sadness, life itself is still enough. <em>As told to Leandra Medine.</em></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since its inception, I have had a natural resistance to <a href="https://www.manrepeller.com/2020/03/online-culture-activities.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram Live</a>. On principle, I don’t like a genre of entertainment that preys on my passivity. While I’m already-quite-passively scrolling on the app, a notification pops up to tell me “@jigsawpuzzle86 is live,” appealing to my curiosity and prompting a knee-jerk reaction to join. I have tried to avoid succumbing to this impulse as best as possible.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">your ex is going Live with your 5th grade teacher tonight at 9PM</p>
<p>&mdash; Drew Anderson (@imdrewanderson) <a href="https://twitter.com/imdrewanderson/status/1242580812362649606?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 24, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>That’s why I found it surprising when, the other Sunday, I estimated how many Instagram Lives I had watched over the weekend. My guess: four. Then I counted: more like 17. I hadn’t hung around for long in most of them, just wanting a glimpse of the action. After that night, I turned it into a game: How many could I hop into in a day?</p>
<p>The experience of opting into an Instagram Live has that grab-bag quality I hadn’t encountered since fooling around on Chatroulette with friends almost 10 years ago. I never know quite what to expect or what’s in store until I’ve committed my handle, my name, to it. It feels a little like jumping into cold water, holding your breath for a second and then buoying back up to the surface, completely visible, all lurky voyeurism or celebrity reverence or boredom revealed when it says, “@edithwyoung joined.” You never know how many people are inside until you’ve entered, of course, and there’s no virtual between-a-rock-and-a-hard-place quite like a Live where you’re unwittingly one of only five spectators. It’s a surreal sensation, crossing the threshold and entering these Lives (literally—entering someone’s life). The irony is not lost on me that a feature called Instagram Live has skyrocketed in popularity, functioning as a substitute to <a href="https://www.manrepeller.com/2020/04/the-banalities-of-quarantine.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in-person programming</a>, while our mortality swims in the forefront of our minds.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-206915" src="https://www.manrepeller.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IG-Live_Break-01-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="366" /></p>
<p>Here’s what I’ve seen: Cat Cohen’s Club Cumming show translated to this new medium until my phone ran out of battery — infusing even its most banal, hiccupy moments with humor as Cat troubleshoots technical difficulties, trying to add guests to the stream but filibustering in a sing-songy voice. Something-of-a-beauty-influencer, a person I’ve never met but follow, going through her beauty cabinet and talking about a Byredo perfume. My uncle playing a song on his guitar, very far away. A writer named Laura Lane reading her work aloud as part of McSweeney’s Issue 59 virtual release party. Cat Cohen, again, talking with Scott Rogowsky of HQ fame, discussing <em>Gossip Girl</em>, which Cohen calls “a show about knowing about hotels.”</p>
<p>Playwright of <em>Slave Play</em> Jeremy O’Harris and <em>SNL</em>’s Chloe Fineman shooting the shit on <em>The Cut</em>’s account, talking about Bode pants, mini-trampolines, and the London Airbnb where O’Harris is staying. Nicholas Braun (Cousin Greg) and Christopher Mintz-Plasse (McLovin) in conversation with a shirtless guy lifting weights who’s waiting for his “quarantine cutie” to stop by. The tail end of Kiernan Shipka catching up with a co-star of hers, I think—he has about three million followers. Emma Roberts and Karah Preiss talking about what they’re reading on the Belletrist account. Zibby Owens (of the podcast “Moms Don’t Have Time To Read”) and her partner, interviewing a writer and their partner, I assume. A comedian I think I like talking to a recently controversial comedian. Jen Gotch and Busy Philipps in cahoots just before the pub date of Jen’s new book. One of Busy’s daughters reads a few lines out loud from a galley, after which she and her mom leave the chat for bedtime and Jen shows the remaining audience her recently renovated bathroom.</p>
<p>Wine editor Marissa Ross hosting a Q&amp;A where I submit a question, and then discover why this is a tactically wise format for audience engagement: It encourages followers to stay in the Live much longer than they usually might, to see if their question gets answered (mine—asking which natural wine I should buy from <a href="https://primalwine.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primal Wine</a> or <a href="https://www.winetherapynyc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wine Therapy</a>—goes unanswered but I stick around for a good long while, waiting). Three different fitness classes: one by Forward Space, another by Indigo Fitness, and a third by Sky Ting Yoga, though I don’t actually do the workouts. The last gasps of John Mayer and Cazzie David theorizing on relationships post-pandemic on Mayer’s recurring Sunday night Instagram show, Current Mood. Nearly everyone I watch is in L.A., because I guess that’s showbiz, baby. At some point, the Instagram Live challenge I’ve set up for myself starts to feel like a game of whack-a-mole, where I am all five moles.</p>
<p>The allure of the feature is clear: as an unscripted event unfolding in real-time, it breaks down another wall of transparency in the Instagram universe, as authenticity-obsessed as it is authenticity-deprived. Will the novelty of this mode-of-connection, which sinisterly required a global pandemic to take off, wear off? And if so, when will we fatigue of Instagram Live? Has it happened already?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>At the intersection of a conflict that finds us wondering how to responsibly support the brands—both big and small—that have often supported us through the philosophical mechanisms of empowerment, expression, community, inspiration, and so forth, resides a gigantic question mark that seems only to get bigger as the weeks proceed, the quarantine persists, and the pandemic grows more catastrophic. The schools of thought tethered to this conflict are many ranging from those that encourage conscious consumption from the small businesses you like (if you can) to those that reinforce the risk at which we put the various hands that must touch the product in order to get it from brand to you. </em></p>
<p><em>I don&#8217;t know what the correct response is, but I do know that I care to support, sustain (even celebrate) the labels that have been there for me when I&#8217;ve needed them. This doesn&#8217;t have to mean commerce, as Harling aptly pointed out in <a href="https://www.manrepeller.com/2020/03/shopping-quarantine.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an e-mail conversation</a> we recently published, &#8220;Small things add up. Engagement/community/awareness is a form of value, even if it’s not as tangible as money in the bank. It still matters, especially because it can have a cumulative effect.&#8221; It also does not supersede the urgency with which we can all donate something.</em></p>
<p><em>And thus, a good thing, I think, that we can do right now is to make you aware of which brands are doing what to support who (be it an organization or themselves) and how. Below you&#8217;ll find a list of designers, which we will be updating in real time, with links to their sites and brief summaries of their efforts. Do with this information </em>whatever<em> you want and above all else, stay safe.</em></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>As Covid-19 has developed over the course of the past months, weeks, and days, our plans have changed and so have our lives. And it appears this will be the norm for a while. In this <a href="https://www.manrepeller.com/2020/03/zoom-wedding.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">series</a> (duration: a few weeks to…not sure?), we’ll share the stories of people who have confronted the unexpected in interesting ways. Today, we have a New York City-based ER doctor, who is staying in an apartment a few blocks away from his wife and child, to protect them from exposure to the virus he’s working around the clock to treat. —Mallory</em></p>
<hr />
<p>I’m an ER doctor in New York City, so on a typical day I take care of all sorts of problems. One moment, I could be treating someone with a heart attack or stroke, and the next minute I could be helping someone figure out whether they’re pregnant or helping someone who’s fractured their arm and needs a splint. The day kind of goes like that—from true emergencies to more mundane or benign complaints. It’s part of what makes our jobs as ER doctors interesting and exciting.</p>
<p>I noticed things were starting to change while working a specific overnight shift about a week and a half ago. I realized there were no other cases in the emergency room. I was no longer seeing that variety of complaints. Everybody had the same symptoms—a fever, a cough, body aches, chills, severe fatigue, and weakness. It’s gotten to the point where it seems like every single person is coming in with the exact same malady, and there’s very little variability now in the care I provide. It’s really quite stunning, because part of what we love as emergency doctors is the unknown, and now these symptoms are part of our daily routine.</p>
<p>Once I realized that the coronavirus was probably everywhere, and every patient and really any interaction outside the house was a possible exposure, my wife and I talked about what we can do to protect each other and our son. Overall, I would say we’re still in the lower-risk category—we definitely see a lot of young people get sick from coronavirus, but those cases are less common than the 70-year-old with multiple medical conditions. That said, we want to make sure we’re not getting sick at the same time. Taking care of a toddler when we’re sicker than we probably have ever been in our lives is not something we can feasibly do.</p>

<p>I’ve talked to a lot of families where both parents are sick, and they’ve said that taking care of their children is the hardest part of all this. So, in order to not take any chances and to not be patient zero in my household, we rented an Airbnb apartment a few blocks away where I’ve been staying for about two-and-a-half weeks now. I just extended it for another couple weeks so we have a safe place for me to stay. I think I was one of the first doctors or nurses to do this. But as the weeks have progressed, I now know of at least half a dozen to a dozen colleagues who are in the same boat. They’ve either sent their kids away or have rented apartments. Now our hospital is providing some limited housing, and there are also hotels opening up rooms at discounted rates for hospital workers.</p>
<p>To keep in touch, we do a lot of Zoom. Last night, we played Taboo with a group of friends, which was an interesting experience, but it worked. I also keep in contact with my work colleagues this way. We have Zoom meetings to keep ourselves grounded and talk about how things are going across the country. There are also text message threads and FaceTiming. I’m probably communicating with my friends outside of work a lot more than I would on a normal basis.</p>
<div class="quote none">I don’t go to work afraid—I go to work thinking I have a job to do.</div>
<p>Usually, when I’m at home, I’m woken up by my toddler kicking me or crying at 6 or 7 in the morning. You’d think I’d actually be getting better sleep when I’m sleeping at an Airbnb on my own. But I find that I’m waking up in the middle of the night, almost every night, around 2 or 3 a.m., feeling very anxious, worried about what the day is going to hold. I don’t remember ever feeling these feelings of doom. I don’t go to work afraid —I go to work thinking I have a job to do, and it’s my responsibility to take care of these patients, which is what I signed up for. It sounds cliche, but we’re taught to run toward danger as emergency doctors. We put our heads down, but we’re shocked, consistently, on a daily basis, about how bad things are getting or can get.</p>

<p>If you look at the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/01/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-cases-map.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent maps</a> that have come out depicting the impact by borough and by neighborhood, they show that the virus is disproportionately affecting the poorer communities in the Bronx and Queens. I think the [numbers are going up for lower-income people] because as people get poorer, they live in larger family households. We know from China that much of the transmission, early on especially, was happening in households. Another component is whether low-income communities are getting the right messaging. Do they have access to the same experts telling them to stay home? They also often have to work hourly jobs to survive, so many of them are doing work like delivery or construction with much more frequency. And then finally, there’s usually less access to care in those communities, so you could have a 40-year-old with uncontrolled diabetes because they don’t get to see a doctor with the same regularity as someone who lives on the Upper West Side or the East Village. The inequality is pretty stark.</p>
<p>Our hospital has been very progressive in terms of how they’re protecting us. We’ve been wearing masks and goggles at all times in all clinical areas for the past three weeks. We clean our goggles after every patient interaction and we try to exchange our masks as often as we can, especially if they get wet or visibly soiled. Many of us are wearing N95 masks the entire time we’re on-shift and then covering those with regular procedure masks—that way we can keep one N95 the whole shift and then just exchange the procedure mask that covers it. We also wear gowns for every patient interaction, and we exchange those gowns between patients. Even if I’m sitting at my computer, I’m still wearing goggles and a face mask at all times. We wash our hands excessively. My hands are raw. I have skin breakdown on the entirety of my left and right hands and wrists, just from scrubbing and washing my hands so frequently. We have indentations on our faces from wearing the masks 12 hours a day. Despite that, we are still getting sick sometimes. We’re human. Sometimes people will take off their goggles and forget and maybe rub their eye with their hand.</p>
<p>I think one problem that the public may not be aware of is that we’re focused on New York City right now—pouring in resources, talking about ventilators, staff coming from across the country to help us. Those things are very important, but I think in the next week or two we’re going to realize that it’s not just New York that needs help. There are cases in New Orleans that are hitting the news, Philadelphia, Detroit. You can always isolate New York State and New York City and pull resources and get ventilators and staff here, but what happens to those areas that are not yet at the same level of pandemic as we are? What happens when we have not one or two cities that are seeing a tremendous spike in cases and it’s now a national issue?</p>
<div class="quote none">If you want to do something to support medical workers today, continue to stay at home.</div>
<p>The other thing that I think is helpful to pass on is that the tracking of cases is valuable in some ways, but it’s also quite misleading. The more you test, the more cases you’re going to find. New York has a lot of cases because we tested people for two weeks—we set up outpatient testing centers, we did drive-through testing centers, urgent cares were testing. But now you’re not going to get a test unless you’re sick enough to be admitted to the hospital. I turn down probably 80% of the people I see in my ER for testing because they’re not sick enough to be admitted. So the case number is going to seem like it’s dropping but what’s more important to follow is the number of people who are dying each day. That’s more indicative of the severity, and it’s also indicative of how many people are getting truly infected. We have to remember that the people who are sick now were infected seven to nine to 10 days ago. So those numbers lag even further. We’re not out of the woods yet.</p>
<p>If you want to do something to support medical workers today, continue to stay at home. 15 days is not a magic bullet. It’s not going to be enough, most likely. This is going to require a longer-term self-isolation and social isolation to make sure we combat this. I still go to Central Park or the East River promenade and see kids playing together. The Great Lawn [in Central Park] is packed with people on a sunny day, listening to music and playing sports. Unless we really make a true commitment, we will continue to see deaths at a level that we’ve never been accustomed to. We are not through this yet, and we, as a younger generation, are not exempt. There are many, many people in their 20s and 30s who are getting critically ill from this disease. I would urge people to take action—before they learn the hard way, when someone they know gets sick.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During a six-month period of extreme money-saving in the lead up to moving to New York, I had the same thing for lunch every single day: a <a href="https://www.manrepeller.com/2020/03/canned-food-recipes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">can of tuna</a> and half an avocado, sliced, served on three round rice cakes. At the time, I wondered if I’d ever get bored of this beyond-basic meal, but every day for six months at 11.30 a.m. (<a href="https://www.manrepeller.com/2020/01/sad-desk-brunch.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the best time to have lunch</a>) I looked forward to it. Even now, more than three years later, I’m still overcome with delight whenever I realize I have all the makings of this meal in my pantry.</p>
<p>While I love my lunch recipe with the whole of my heart, I’m very aware that most people—particularly the tuna-fish averse—would definitely not. In an effort to find more delicious but simple recipes to add to my limited mental recipe book, I reached out to three female food experts (read: restaurant owners and chefs) to share their best recipe with fewer than five ingredients. Here’s what they came up with:</p>

<h2>The Homemade Salsa That Will Make You Feel Like You’re Capable of Anything</h2>
<p>Natalie Hernandez, chef and owner of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bocasanta_nyc/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boca Santa</a></p>
<p><em>Salsa Tatemada is our go-to salsa. It goes with everything from scrambled eggs to sandwiches to quesadillas to tacos, of course.<img class=" wp-image-206859 alignleft" src="https://www.manrepeller.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/040220_Four-Ingredient-Recipes_Salsa-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="437" height="583" /></em></p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />
4–5 Serrano peppers<br />
4 plum tomatoes<br />
2 medium garlic cloves<br />
1½ teaspoons salt</p>

Place a <a href="https://amzn.to/3aCqwbL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comal</a> or a <a href="https://rstyle.me/+XIyPw5y2-ceoXDOn4JyYMg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cast-iron skillet</a> over high heat. Place plum tomatoes and Serrano peppers on skillet or comal to char, flip occasionally, until all ingredients are cooked through and charred, about 15–20 minutes. Turn the heat off the comal or skillet, and set aside.</p>
<p>While veggies are charring, place garlic cloves, salt, and ⅕ cup water in <a href="https://rstyle.me/+b9i2wlztbLnjzN-lrxc1kg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blender</a> and blend on high for about 30 seconds, or until garlic is completely broken down and there are few to no chunks left.</p>
<p>Once veggies are charred and cooked fully through, add them to blender, making sure to have removed stems from peppers, and pulse veggies and garlic mixture in blender until veggies are broken down but still have a chunky consistency.</p>
<h2>The Cookie That’s a Thousand Times Simpler Than It Looks (and Tastes)</h2>
<p>Christina Tosi, chef, founder, and owner of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/milkbarstore/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Milk Bar</a></p>
<p><em>This is the recipe I grew up making. It&#8217;s what I make with my nieces and my family, and it always gives me a little sense of togetherness—plus, it&#8217;s only four ingredients!</em></p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened<br />
½ cup packed light brown sugar<br />
2 cups flour, plus more for dusting<br />
½ teaspoon salt</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong><br />
Heat the oven to 350°F. Spray your <a href="https://amzn.to/3bMpc6y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">baking sheets</a>.</p>
<p>In a large bowl, combine the softened butter and sugar with a wooden spoon (or in a stand mixer with the paddle attachment). Mix until the butter and sugar are smooth. In a separate bowl, stir together the salt and flour, then mix this into the sugar and butter, a little at a time. After the first two additions of flour (if you’re not doing this with a stand mixer) it may be easiest to ditch the spoon and use your hands.</p>
<p>Form the dough into a ball, and divide the ball into three pieces. Place each piece into a <a href="https://amzn.to/2R6DWFd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">plastic sandwich bag</a> and pat the dough smooth and flat with your hands. Refrigerate for 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Dust a clean, dry section of your countertop with flour. Place the dough down and use a flour-dusted <a href="https://rstyle.me/+gXi6bm571YNszEBwDn1MiQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rolling pin</a> to roll it out until it is a ¼ inch thick (use a ruler!) Use your favorite cookie cutters to cut the dough into shapes. Using a <a href="https://rstyle.me/+6P7Q8o-KrWdy61pVkrNo5A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">metal spatula</a>, lift the shapes and transfer them to your greased baking sheets. If you use a range of sizes and shapes, keep the bigger cut-outs on one baking sheet and the smaller cut-outs on the other baking sheet.</p>
<p>Bake the cookies at 350°F for 5 to 10 minutes (depending on size of your cut-outs), until the edges of the cookies are golden brown. With oven mitts, remove the baking sheets from the oven and cool the cookies completely on the baking sheets.</p>
<h2>The Mac and Cheese That’s Begging For Your Potato Chip Crumbs</h2>

<p><em>A simple comforting recipe that can be made quickly and feel luxurious rich with even cheaper ingredients.</em></p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-206858 size-full" src="https://www.manrepeller.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/040220_Four-Ingredient-Recipes_MacandCheese-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="1708" height="2560" /></p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />
1 lb pasta (any shape will work here—at MeMe’s we use shells)<br />
1 12 oz can of evaporated milk<br />
1 lb shredded cheddar cheese (any kind of easily melting cheese works here—I like sharp cheddar)<br />
8 oz American cheese cut into cubes</p>
<p>Optional toppings: A pinch of salt, chili oil, or crumbled potato chips (really anything crunchy!)</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong><br />
In a large pot, boil salted water. Then, cook pasta until al dente.</p>
<p>For cheese sauce: In a <a href="https://fave.co/2UEufA9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">saucepan</a> over medium heat, add evaporated milk, shredded cheese, and American cheese. Stir frequently with a flexible spatula to avoid scorching cheese. When the sauce is melted, add cooked pasta. Stir until combined.</p>
<p>Top each serving with crushed potato chips and something spicy. If you are making a batch for just yourself and plan to have leftovers, I recommend storing the cheese sauce and the cooked pasta separately. This way you can reheat the sauce before adding the pasta, to prevent it from overcooking. The cheese sauce is also great added to eggs for a cheesy scramble, or on chips like queso.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="preamble"><strong><strong>8:30 a.m.:</strong> I have been up for one hour. </strong> In the time since I&#8217;ve risen, I am ashamed to confess that I have taken 21 photos with my iPhone—one, a response to the morning dressing prompt from Man Repeller&#8217;s <a href="https://manrepeller.typeform.com/to/cdYWWq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thoughtline</a> (the artist formerly known as a text service). I have attempted to eat three breakfasts, starting with a bowl of cereal, which was co-opted by my daughter Madeline, who was consuming one of her own. The second was a trio of banana bread muffins which I made last Sunday, one-and-a-half of which were co-opted by a combination of Laura (my other daughter) and Abie (my son. I mean partner). Finally, I toasted two slices of bread, slathered avocado on them, topped with a hard-boiled egg , and no one, I repeat no one, tried to get in the way of my eating them. It seems in order to feed myself around these parts, I must relegate my desire for something sweet and eat only<a href="https://www.manrepeller.com/2019/04/eggs-are-bad.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> the boring savory artifacts</a> of my refrigerator. Noted.</div>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-206808 aligncenter" src="https://www.manrepeller.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/200401_ADIL_1.jpg" alt="" width="2100" height="1569" /></p>
<p><strong>9:21 a.m.:</strong> By this hour, I&#8217;ve worn exactly three outfits if you count the pajamas that I started in, which I do, because they were an integral part of the Thoughtline&#8217;s WFH Dressing Challenge. I&#8217;ve been sitting cross-legged at the head of my bed with my computer in my lap and am now wearing a navy blue<a href="https://rstyle.me/+LCtn9RyvjQXDbhSQFUzFxw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> day dress</a>&#8211;<em>cum</em>-night gown and <a href="https://rstyle.me/+r0m4UOPUwI3TmHZ5W04Ezw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">silver slippers</a>. I&#8217;ve read a 10-page memo from a credit analyst, I&#8217;ve re-read the draft of a story that&#8217;s going up next week. I&#8217;ve picked my left eyebrow and evaluated the most recent trove of comments under <a href="https://www.manrepeller.com/2020/03/shopping-quarantine.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this story</a> underlining the morally-ripe conflict of whether one should shop right now. Tl;dr: It&#8217;s complicated. The most disappointing and probably belated discrepancy I&#8217;m discovering amid this outbreak is the odds at which financial security and humanism stand.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-206809 size-full" src="https://www.manrepeller.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/200401_ADIL_2.jpg" alt="" width="2100" height="1569" /></p>
<p><strong>10:36 a.m.:</strong> Have you been bickering with your partner? I know this question only applies if you cohabitate, but Abie came over to give me a glass of water a little while ago and proceeded to kiss me, then smell me, and remark that I have b.o. Before the remark, he smelled me like four times, even obstructing mobility in my arm to lift it above my head and really get his nasal passage in there, at which point I snapped, expectedly in my view, but he snapped back. In his gentle but biting Abie way he said, &#8220;If you don&#8217;t want my nose in your armpit, just say that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t realize I had to when I signed on the dotted line, ya fuckin&#8217; freak.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he brought me a glass of water, unprompted, just as my throat was getting dry. Googly eyes.</p>
<p><strong><img class=" wp-image-206813 alignright" src="https://www.manrepeller.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_4322-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="424" height="565" />12:16 p.m.:</strong> Made lentil noodles for Madelaur, heated up some veggie burgers that I have had frozen since January—remember January?—and roasted some sweet potatoes and pan-fried cubes of chicken mixed with coconut aminos for Abie and me. I will say that I am pleased that where I once thought I could never be any good at running a household, it seems I can be pretty decent. I do not wish to do this forever, but I&#8217;m not letting the message get lost on me. Incidentally, it&#8217;s true that if you put your mind to something, you can achieve it. You don&#8217;t even necessarily have to want it, there just has to be no other option.</p>
<p><strong>12:18 p.m.:</strong> I just donated $100 to <a href="https://support.winnyc.org/give/279469/#!/donation/checkout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Win</a>. I&#8217;m not saying this to blow steam up my own ass or earn altruism points, but if you can donate anything, Win is the largest provider of shelter for homeless families in New York. Last year they helped transition 700 families out of shelter into their own homes! Employment is a requirement to apply for a housing voucher with Win, and after last week, the 53% of Win parents who were employed had dropped significantly, leaving the 5,400 children that the shelter serves at risk.</p>
<p>I still don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m going to do to make a dent, but I won&#8217;t continue to discredit the small things.</p>
<p><strong>1:05 p.m.:</strong> Just got home from a walk around the neighborhood. I wore gloves (but not a mask) and did not touch anything as I traversed Mulberry to Mott to Elizabeth Street and back. I was on the phone with my mom the whole time, who was telling me about a Friday-night dinner that occurred two weeks ago in Great Neck. Among the ten people who congregated to celebrate the Jewish Sabbath—immediate family members, to be clear, who live in different, neighboring homes—five got sick. Two died. I still don&#8217;t think we are aware of the severity of this virus.</p>
<p><strong><img class=" wp-image-206810 alignleft" src="https://www.manrepeller.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_4403-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="244" height="325" />1:25 p.m.:</strong> I&#8217;m feeling like a sociopath, in case you are wondering, because after letting the news sit heavy on my chest, I am about to go Live on Man Repeller&#8217;s Instagram to indulge a home tour, breaking down in less-than-exquisite detail the trivialities of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B-FaeGyn-Et/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this post</a>. I couldn&#8217;t complete the tour because Abie was meditating in our bedroom, so instead I just let my head spin around my neck while I tried to catch comments, push notifications, and maintain eye contact. Going live is like indulging monkey brain to a far-out degree of magnitude but also, does anyone even actually want to watch them? Mallory said they&#8217;re kind of like fashion week events approaching peak whats-the-point-ism to the extent that everyone thinks they need to do one and no one really wants to go (or watch). Some of them make sense! Don&#8217;t get me (or her) wrong. But I thought it was a good observation.</p>
<p><strong>4:30 p.m.:</strong> How you doing? In the past three hours, I have had one meeting, taken one phone call, recorded one more installment of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B-UUqIUg69f/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this thing</a> we started doing last week and am about to make dinner for everyone. I basically have not moved from the floor of my bedroom bathroom, which I say only to remind myself that even though I&#8217;m not physically moving, I am moving. You know what? I should physically move. I&#8217;m going to do 30 jumping jacks and 20 squats, then I&#8217;ll go cook salmon for Abie and make pizza for the kids and me.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-206811 aligncenter" src="https://www.manrepeller.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/200401_ADIL_3.jpg" alt="" width="2100" height="1569" /></p>
<p><strong>7 p.m.:</strong> I did it—I made pizza for the kids and me, using a cauliflower crust from Trader Joe&#8217;s, topped with tomato sauce, the last leaves of a giant bag of arugula and shredded Swiss cheese. I cut up romaine hearts and mixed in some avocado and toasted walnuts and dressed it in balsamic vinegar. Abie had that next to a piece of pan-fried salmon. I also made a new cracker/crudite dip for the week, which has pretty much been <a href="https://www.manrepeller.com/2020/02/nutritional-yeast-review.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the best food hack</a> I&#8217;ve uncovered during quarantine. So long as you can use nutritious, caloric items like chickpeas or lentils, you can hold yourself over during the hundreds if not thousands of snack breaks you are wont to take over the course of the day. I guess almond butter works too. But in case you&#8217;re wondering, I made a lentil/walnut dip this go around with:</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-206812 aligncenter" src="https://www.manrepeller.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/200401_ADIL_4.jpg" alt="" width="2100" height="1569" /></p>
<p><em>1 can lentils, drained (or cup of cooked lentils if you don&#8217;t have a can; cook them with 6 cups of water for 20 minutes)</em></p>
<p><em>1 cup toasted walnuts (put them in the oven for like, 10 minutes at 350)</em></p>
<p><em>3 teaspoons miso (not required but I really like miso)</em></p>
<p><em>Half an onion and two cloves of garlic, sauteed (Put them in a pan on oil for like, 15 minutes or until the onion gets mushy wushy), </em><em>THEN THROW IT ALL IN A BLENDER, CALL IT A METAPHOR FOR YOUR FEELINGS AND MIX THEM ALL UP IN THE HOPES THAT WHEN THEY EMERGE FROM THE BLENDER, THEY&#8217;LL TASTE BETTER TOGETHER THAN THEY DID WHEN THEY WERE SEPARATE.</em></p>
<p>I should go to bed.</p>
<div class="endmark"><strong>11:42 p.m.:</strong> <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81115994" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This show</a> is fucking crazy.</div>
<p><em><strong>Feature image</strong> styled with <a href="https://rstyle.me/+DPWkPsJ-TZZ9y6Y0HJPbSw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Roller Rabbit</strong> pajamas</a> and <a href="https://rstyle.me/+PuyCQkRQeWDRB4gzviLChQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Ray-ban</strong> sunglasses</a>.</em></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Until two and a half weeks ago, my &#8220;saved&#8221; folder on Instagram told the indisputable tale of someone planning a wedding. It overflowed with images of long tables lined with colorful flower arrangements, bridal looks from old runway shows, hair #inspo, <a href="https://www.manrepeller.com/2019/08/buying-vintage-furniture-online.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vintage</a> stamps, registry fodder, no-makeup makeup, invitation suites, and candid shots of <a href="https://www.manrepeller.com/2019/11/ruby-redstone-wedding.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">newlyweds</a> obscured by a shower of petals. The last thing I bookmarked before the phrase &#8220;social distancing&#8221; became more commonplace than &#8220;hello&#8221; was a photo from a reception at a vineyard in Virginia: The couple set up a shelved trellis stacked with glasses in different shades of blue, so guests could serve themselves cold lemonade from an aesthetically pleasing dispenser.</p>

<p>The same day I saved it, I received an email from a friend confirming that her dinner party was still happening as planned the next evening, unless that was crazy? Everyone assured her it wasn&#8217;t, that it would be fine, because at this point, fine was honestly how things felt. Our offices had declared working from home &#8220;optional&#8221; but not mandatory, restaurants remained open for business, face masks were rare&#8211;and besides, it was a small group, only eight people, minimal risk. So we all showed up, toting bottles of red wine as thank-you gifts, deciding we probably shouldn&#8217;t hug and teasing each other about it. It was one of those truly perfect nights when everyone gets just the right amount of drunk, when there&#8217;s enough bolognese to have seconds, when the suggestion of playing a game after dinner sounds genuinely appealing.</p>
<p>Like the wedding photos in my saved folder, this evening feels like a relic of another era. I&#8217;ve seen tongue-in-cheek tweets referring to the time before coronavirus as &#8220;beforetimes,&#8221; which is less humorous than it is appropriately dramatic. The distinction between <em>then</em> and <em>now</em> is stark to the point of seeming fictional, like some trick of the memory. My only evidence that I&#8217;m not losing it completely is the tangible line of demarcation that divides the wedding photos from what I started bookmarking next: memes. Corona memes, to be precise.</p>

<p>If I were attempting to psychoanalyze our collective processing of the bizarre experience that is sudden isolation via social media&#8211;which I suppose, to some extent, I am&#8211;I would call the influx of corona-related memes and jokes the &#8220;denial&#8221; phase. Denial that we were grieving the loss of our old routines, and with them, the assurance that it was safe to exit our apartments, much less eat dinner with friends. Band-Aids though they may have been, the jokes were still entertaining: Venn diagrams about chillin at home, pleas for Apple&#8217;s screen time reports to be suspended, spot-on comparisons to <em>Russian Doll</em>, alignment charts, <a href="https://www.manrepeller.com/2019/11/washing-sweaters.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hand-washing</a> quips&#8230; I bookmarked them by the dozen, each one an artifact of the mounting effort it took to maintain a sense of levity.</p>

<p>But news of the virus and its impact evolved rapidly, and with it, my instinct about what variety of content was worth memorializing and revisiting. As quickly as quarantine transformed from possibility to inevitability, many iterations of corona-related humor shifted from uplifting to unsettling. So instead, I bookmarked a photo of a man holding up a sign at a hospital window thanking the emergency room doctors for saving his wife, a clip of Hoda breaking into tears on the <em>Today Show </em>after a conversation with a football player who donated $5 million to coronavirus relief in Louisiana, a video of nurses taking a quick yoga break, a video of someone leaving toilet paper and hand sanitizer for people making deliveries, a PSA about businesses collecting donations to help feed those in need so I could remember to contribute later&#8211;any sliver of content that made me feel less alone in my spirals of anxious uncertainty, anything to feel connected to something bigger than the confines of my apartment that I know I&#8217;m deeply fortunate to live and work in right now.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure what the whims of my saved folder will call for next during this strange time, but based on the recipe for bright, creamy corn pasta I just bookmarked, I have a hunch it&#8217;s likely to be cooking-related. I rarely cooked before all of this happened, but it is slowly becoming less of a chore born of necessity and more of a pleasure born of the desire to delimit the end of each day with something tangible, something nourishing. I scroll through the &#8220;explore&#8221; tab on Instagram and pause every time I see a photo that looks edible. I fantasize about baking a large casserole in the oven and freezing the leftovers. I squeezed sausage out of their casings for the first time last weekend, and it felt more meditative than anything I&#8217;d done in days.</p>
<p>For now, like many aspects of life as we knew it, my wedding planning is in limbo. I can&#8217;t get my dress fitted until the seamstresses who are making it can safely return to work. I can&#8217;t meet with the rector and organist at the church where the ceremony is supposed to take place. I might have to postpone the event altogether. I know these problems are minuscule in the grand scheme of what is happening right now&#8211;trivial, even&#8211;but they&#8217;re also a glimmer of what awaits in the aftertimes: celebrating together. Dressing up. Dancing outside. Sharing dessert out of the same bowl, all the sweeter because we had to wait.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s officially April, whether you can believe it or not, and spring feels 100% sprung. <a href="https://www.manrepeller.com/2020/03/out-of-office-apropos-7-ensembles-we-wore-while-wfh-this-week.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Last week</a>, six members of Team MR shared how they got dressed for a day that involved work but no commute or IRL meetings. Below, Harling, Mikaela, Sabrina, Mallory, and Edith do the same while discussing the shoes they miss, outfits they&#8217;re planning for (maybe) May, and the art of taking a one-legged selfie in non-stretch denim. Behold, another edition of Spring Office Apropos, extremely shaken, with an unprecedented twist.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Harling</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-206740 size-full" src="https://www.manrepeller.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/WFH_officeapropro_Harling1-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="2560" /><br />
I didn&#8217;t feel like wearing a practical WFH ensemble today, so instead I styled myself in an outfit I would like to wear on the first 70-degree day in May, safety protocols permitting. It was nice to clothe myself in items that aren&#8217;t conducive to wallowing around in an apartment (see: <a href="https://rstyle.me/+BPE7zZr65aZw_qD0Sd0UTw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">denim shorts</a> that dig into my pelvis every time I sit and a <a href="https://www.leepfayfer.com/collections/capsule-collection/products/cote-dazur-top?_pos=4&amp;_sid=98ac6c1bb&amp;_ss=r&amp;variant=16116490731563" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">linen crop top</a> that is prone to wrinkles, not to mention the completely ancillary <a href="https://rstyle.me/+fFOeazRe4B7sWjDC7vuGMg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">purse</a> and <a href="https://fave.co/2YKdkyR" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sunglasses</a>)—it &#8216;s like holding a plank for 60 seconds, just to prove to myself that I still can. I will admit that I changed out of the shorts after an hour or so, but their effect lingered on. For all of the limitations of homebound dressing, I do think it&#8217;s worth celebrating the fact that you can wear exactly what your gut wants or even needs, completely independent of whatever the weather outside happens to be doing.</p>
<h2>Mikaela</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-206742 size-full" src="https://www.manrepeller.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/WFH_officeapropro_Mikaela-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="2560" /><br />
Aside from the fact I had to heavy-duty clean this entire countertop and put my bevy of drugstore makeup ~just~ out of frame to take this photo, I’m relatively proud of my ability to one-legged-selfie while in <a href="https://rstyle.me/+4hO0kiKN2Lp887kqPdW_Tg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">non-stretch denim</a>! Believe it or not, these jeans are actually comfortable WFH wear, probably due to the massive rip in the right leg. I wear the same set of earrings every single day: my <a href="https://rstyle.me/+_8OXXdGLRqsiWkx5NcbYLg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vintage Oscar de la Renta hoops</a> and two Repeller charm earrings (without the charms, which are currently hanging out on some necklaces of mine). I doubled up on the scrunchies because we all have to find a way to put a little pep in our step these days.</p>
<h2>Sabrina</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-206743 size-full" src="https://www.manrepeller.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/OFFICE_AP_SABRINA-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="1689" height="2560" /><br />
I’ve worn a variation of this very outfit almost every day while working from home. I recommend <a href="https://fave.co/2wQ1kzS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bike shorts</a> for two reasons: in case halfway through the day you get the urge to do jumping jacks, and because wearing them almost feels like you’re not wearing pants at all. The other part of my WFH recipe includes a <a href="https://rstyle.me/+jPdSUy8Ac-9F_tQiOXG-FQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">button-up</a>. This one is on rotation because it reminds me of my dad. And if you know me, you know <a href="https://rstyle.me/+Un61X_UNwv0gitAGnJBmEw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">these boots</a>. I don’t wear them at home, but damn do I miss how they feel on my feet.</p>
<h2>Mallory</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-206823 size-full" src="https://www.manrepeller.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/opt1-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="2560" /><br />
I&#8217;m currently staying at a friend&#8217;s place, in a bedroom that is almost entirely different shades of green—it&#8217;s on the walls, carpet, bedding, etc. as you can sort-of see. It would be fair to say that this is my most compelling source of inspiration right now, since I have not seen much else in the material world for the past two or so weeks. Anyway, on deck we have my trusty <a href="https://fave.co/2JxwUp6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A.P.C. cardigan</a>, <a href="https://rstyle.me/+WcSvIMEJAAAK4wqnLX1zgQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vintage Hawaiian-print shorts</a> I purchased at Brimfield last year (which have a matching shirt I didn&#8217;t pack), and super-soft <a href="https://hanselfrombasel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hansel from Basel socks</a> you can&#8217;t see, which I bought in just about every color during the holiday sale season. The only other thing I can imagine I&#8217;m drawing inspiration from here is that <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/simpsons-homer-backs-into-the-bushes-meme-gif.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simpsons meme</a> where Homer disappears himself into the bushes.</p>

This morning, I got up early to write a draft of a story and then went for the briefest and clammiest of runs, after which I looked into my closet and thought it might be refreshing to see my form in something other than extreme loungewear. It was a thrill, and lovelier still, to wear something that&#8217;s been waiting out the winter in my closet, saving itself up for summer. A <a href="https://rstyle.me/+jjJA9yz81YACl4Fd9QLPkg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrap dress</a> is like a glorified robe, so it didn&#8217;t feel like a tremendous commitment. I was adamant that the <a href="https://fave.co/2X9I6jN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">socks</a> match. This whole ensemble didn&#8217;t last long, though: It had the life span of a few professional tasks. I eventually set out to write another draft and wanted to exercise one of the perks of working, and therefore writing, from home, which is to type with your feet up. And that&#8217;s when my sweatpants found me crawling back to them.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oh man. When I set out to write this ditty, née &#8220;Trust Me Try It: Coffeemate is the Greatest Coffee Mate,&#8221; there was a zero percent chance that I would not surmise the aforementioned really is the greatest coffee mate. That it&#8217;s the little things &#8212; like texture so creamy it flows seamlessly into your cup as if a silk runner with wind blowing through it, flavor so sweet it soothes dark beans like a hug mid-quarrel. I had a cup sitting right next to me! The mate was swirling around &#8212; it looked like it was dancing, summoning my &#8220;come hither&#8221;: <em>Bring your lips to the cup</em>, it said. <em>I will make you feel good</em>.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-206795 size-full alignright" src="https://www.manrepeller.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/HowDoYouTakeYourMorningCoffee_Embed-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="2560" /></p>
<p>And that &#8212; feeling good in the most harmless, trivial, and quotidian way &#8212; is part of what I strive for these days. But guess what? It&#8217;s not harmless. The Coffeemate, I mean. I just learned that they&#8217;re embroiled in a lawsuit! I was fact-checking the ingredients, which are disgusting, which I already knew, (corn syrup is, like, the first listed item) only to discover that their asses are being sued because their bottles say there are 0g of trans fats in the product but significant traces of hydrogenated oils, which the FDA mandated are not safe for consumption in 2017, float among several flavors. What the actual fuck? Is this why I can never find it at the grocery store? I have not investigated deeper than a shallow string of google searches, the whole fiasco is nonetheless problematic for a number of reasons, the most unilateral among them that I am newly in possession of a 64 oz. pumping bottle to complement the morning hours of the month of April which will henceforth do no such complementing.</p>
<p>And to think, I had landed upon this fairly perfect equation of three parts <a href="https://us.oatly.com/collections/products" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">oat milk</a>, one part &#8216;mate. So before I continue, let me just say <em>No</em>. No. Coffeemate is not the greatest coffee mate. But the sentiment remains and if you, too, are in pursuit of the kind of quotidian good feeling that reinstates your faith in the notion that it really <em>is</em> the little things, there&#8217;s a way to take the principle of discovering a micro life upgrade and blend it into your routine. For now, I&#8217;m back to the drawing board. And specifically fixated on doing something to soup up my morning beverage—it&#8217;s what I look forward to most at the top of the day. So, should I take up <a href="https://www.manrepeller.com/2020/03/milk-frother-review.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jasmin&#8217;s recommendation</a> and get a frother? Commit myself implicitly to<a href="https://www.manrepeller.com/2019/07/oat-milk-taste-test.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> oat milk</a> once again? Should I puree dates and mix it in? Toast coconut oil and <a href="https://www.manrepeller.com/2018/12/what-the-hell-happened-to-coffee-in-2018.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">make it a bullet</a>?</p>
<p>How do you make your morning coffee? For the love of roasting beans, please, tell me! I&#8217;m newly in need of advice.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I would not say my sex life was rip-roaring fun prior to the New York City-wide mandate of self-isolation. But now, to no one’s surprise, it’s a barren wasteland. Tumbleweeds.</p>
<p>I guess the most ironic piece of this is that right before coronavirus started settling in, I was feeling better than I have in a while. After a long-term relationship ended in the fall—followed by some short-term dating adventures in the winter that also wrapped up anticlimactically—I had taken a few months to acquaint myself with <a href="https://www.manrepeller.com/2019/06/relationship-hindsight.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">what I wanted and who I am</a> and what I’m looking for. As of a few days prior to self-isolation, I was ready to start dating again. I even had a conversation with my therapist about it.</p>
<p>Instead I’m here, now, slowly devolving with <a href="https://www.manrepeller.com/2020/03/quarantine-baking-projects.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">baked goods</a> and repeat viewings of <em>Tiger King</em>. I work in digital media, and my work life has been demanding since the start of self-isolation, even just being in close proximity to news every day. I haven’t had a lot of brain space to think about sex, but I’ve somehow had more than enough to think about being alone. So, for better or for worse, I’m here to present to you: A week in the life of my celibacy.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Monday</h2>
<p>I’m writing this from the relatively early perspective of Week 2 of self-isolation, so right now I can say it’s <em>so easy</em> to not think about sex on a busy workday. Not sure if I’ll be singing that tune on Week 5. Luckily for me, the anxieties of our present crisis, compounded with my tenuous grip on reality, have me completely de-sexed today. An orgasm: One less thing for me to have to worry about. I finish work at 7pm, make myself a healthy dinner, and go for a walk in the cool evening. Rather than feel emotionally overwhelmed, I think of that time my ex [redacted] my [redacted]. I go home and take care of the situation myself with my vibrator of choice.</p>
<h2>Tuesday</h2>
<p>All right, so no, rip-roaring fun wasn’t exactly true for the past two months. I was sleeping with my ex. I was also sleeping with a woman. Since then, the woman has moved on to a woman who isn’t me. I see they’re quarantined together, according to Instagram. Witnessing it feels like a wound, but a wound of my own making. My ex has moved on to a life that doesn’t involve “me.” I still care about both of them. And both of them were great in bed. Sex doesn’t even cross my mind until right before I fall asleep. I think about previous lovers, but not in an intimate way, more in a fond way. Nothing arouses me in the moment. I miss intimacy. I miss embraces and fingers on skin. No telling when the next time is that I’ll have it.</p>
<h2>Wednesday</h2>
<p>In between watching <em>Tiger King</em>, I’m also watching <em>High Maintenance</em>. And something about the show just gets me hot. It could be the fact that it’s just genuinely good television. Or I could be into The Dude? I’m not sure. I pour myself a glass of wine right after I finish a particularly draining day of work that I feel lucky to have, and I pair it with Annie’s Mac n’ Cheese. I need to go to the grocery store again, but thinking about going these days gives me a lot of anxiety. I guess that’s the underlying theme of this sex diary. I end up pouring myself two more glasses of wine after streaming more episodes and am more tired than anything else so I scrap the idea of even attempting solo time. I swipe through Tinder for a while and feel completely blah. What’s even the point of talking to someone for weeks if you don’t know if you’ll like them when you meet in real life.</p>
<h2>Thursday</h2>
<p>I wake up HORNY. Like <a href="https://twitter.com/GraceSpelman/status/1239924878305878019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a>. I guess that’s a delayed reaction from last night. I know that if I jump right into the news I’ll turn it off, but it’s nice to feel true, primal arousal, in a way that’s different from nostalgia or dull desire. Call it my weird thing but… I read erotic lit online. If I’m tired of relying on memory or disinterested in anything visual (most of the time), this is my go-to. I’ve always masturbated to words. I read a mediocre story about a man and a woman on a bus, weirdly, and it does the job. I don’t think about sex for the rest of the day, but the more I look at the Cuomo brothers the more I’m convinced I would [redacted]. You know when I write redacted it’s not the editors actually redacting, right? I’m sparing you.</p>
<h2>Friday</h2>
<p>A notoriously inappropriate boy I know from living abroad&#8211;with whom I haven’t spoken in years&#8211;slides into my DMs and says, “The big question is how many times are you doing it a day” with a wink emoji. I do not respond. But I do think about it. I guess my unsexy answer is once, if that? I always considered myself a pretty sexual person, but the mix of emotional stress and work anxiety has me at a new libido low. I look absently at my Hinge account and see that four people have liked me. I nix them all. I still don’t feel like this is the right time or place for fostering any kind of connection. I know others do. Some of my friends are chatting with people on the apps. Maybe they’ll go on walks, six feet apart. A part of me envies them for being able to try right now.</p>
<h2>Saturday</h2>
<p>Bored today and deeply craving gentle emotional intimacy. I know I can’t have the physical kind right now, so it makes me want to be soothed. I call my family members one by one, then FaceTime with my best friend, who lives in Manhattan and whom, obviously, I haven’t seen physically for weeks. I’d do anything to reach through the phone and give her a hug. I bake cookies from a cookbook my roommate owns and think about being held. I lie down to take a nap and curl around one of my pillows like it’s a body, thinking to myself that this isn’t even all that bad. Physical touch for the sake of physical touch doesn’t do much for me, anyway. I know when I’m out of this that I’ll need something primal and immediate, and I’ll settle for it. Afterwards, I’ll feel unfulfilled. When there’s tenderness, care, and respect behind touch, it means the world to me. I really wonder when I’ll find that again.</p>
