The site is used by researchers from all over the world, to access papers they otherwise have a hard time accessing.    Academic publishers are not happy with the service. They see the site as a threat to their multi-billion dollar businesses and have tried to shut it down through several lawsuits. At the same time, publishers work to have the site blocked by ISPs around the world.     Blocking Lawsuit in India    In recent weeks, Sci-Hub has become the focus of a high-profile lawsuit in India where Elsevier, Wiley, and American Chemical Society want the site blocked. The case isn't as straightforward as in other countries, in part because access to Sci-Hub is seen as vital by many local academics.    Earlier this week, the Indian High Court declared the case an \"issue of public importance,\" inviting experts and scientists to testify on the matter. Meanwhile, however, the pressure on Sci-Hub grows.     Twitter Suspends Sci-Hub Permanently    This morning, Sci-Hub founder Alexandra Elbakyan informed us that Twitter has suspended the site's official account, which had over 185k followers and operated without notable issues for nine years. Elbakyan believes that it may be directly related to the legal action in India.     \"It happened right after Indian scientists revolted against Elsevier and other academic publishers after Sci-Hub posted on Twitter about the danger of being blocked - thousands of people spoke up against this on Twitter.    \"Now Twitter said to all of them, SHUT UP!\" Elbakyan adds.     One of Sci-Hub's Latest Tweets    The reason for the suspension is related to Twitter's \"counterfeit policy.\" The social media platform doesn't list any concrete takedown requests but simply mentions the policy violation and the fact that its decision can't be appealed.     \"Your account has been permanently suspended due to a violation of Twitter policies, in particular the Counterfeiting Policy. This decision is not subject to appeal,\" Twitter writes, translated from Russian.    Twitter's email to Sci-Hub    According to Sci-Hub's founder, the suspension is an effort to censor her and all those who support the site in its legal battle against the powerful publishers.     Massive Support From Academics    Over the past several days, many Indian researchers and academics voiced their support of the site in replies to Sci-Hub's tweets. While the tweets from these researchers are still up, they're harder to find. And Sci-Hub can no longer call for support either.    \"Now after the Sci-Hub Twitter ban that's all gone. Now they can lie and pretend, that there was no support and there will be no easy way to check that!\"    Before the suspension, Elbakyan already started archiving Sci-Hub's tweets and responses. Not just for the historical record but also to use in court, where they will be used as evidence.    \"I collected these responses and forwarded them to my lawyer in India, Nilesh Jain. We were planning to read them aloud in court to prove that Sci-Hub should not be blocked,\" Elbakyan tells us.    Some responses, more here, archived by Sci-Hub    While there are some academics who would prefer to see Sci-Hub gone, the site is supported by researchers all over the world. This is no different in India, where many scholars don't have access to expensive subscriptions.     Damaging Paywalls    A lot of the top research papers are hidden behind paywalls, which is a continued source of frustration for many.    \"The only reason students from egregiously underfunded institutions in India manage to do quality research is because of platforms like Sci-Hub and Libgen. If you block them, you block research. Period,\" writes Sushmita Pati, Assistant Professor of Political Science.    TorrentFreak reached out to Twitter asking for clarification on their decision to ban the account but the company didn't immediately reply.     Questions Remain, as does Sci-Hub    As far as we know, Sci-Hub's Twitter account didn't link directly to infringing content. There were some tweets linking to the Sci-Hub site, but these have been around for a long time. Nothing seems to have changed substantially.     Twitter is known to terminate repeat infringers but Elbakyan notes that this account suspension came out of the blue. At this point, it's unclear if Twitter acted on its own or if rightsholders complained.     With Sci-Hub removed from Twitter, the site has lost its presence on the social media platform. However, whether that will do much to stop researchers from accessing the site is doubtful. If recent history has shown anything, it's that increased legal pressure on the site only increases its popularity.

Twitter has suspended the account of Sci-Hub, a site that offers a free gateway to paywalled research. The site is accused of violating the counterfeit policy of the social media platform. However, founder Alexandra Elbakyan believes that this is an effort to silence the growing support amidst a high profile court case in India.
</p>

<div class="article__body">
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/sci-hub1.png" alt="Sci-Hub" width="225" height="281" class="alignright size-full wp-image-148552" />By offering free access to millions of ‘paywalled’ research papers, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub">Sci-Hub</a> is often described as “The Pirate Bay of Science”.</p>
<p>The site is used by researchers from all over the world, to access papers they otherwise have a hard time accessing.</p>
<p>Academic publishers are not happy with the service. They see the site as a threat to their multi-billion dollar businesses and have tried to shut it down through several lawsuits. At the same time, publishers work to have the site blocked by ISPs around the world. </p>
<h2>Blocking Lawsuit in India</h2>
<p>In recent weeks, Sci-Hub has become the focus of a high-profile <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/sci-hub-libgen-face-isp-blocking-in-india-after-publishers-file-high-court-complaint-201227/">lawsuit in India</a> where Elsevier, Wiley, and American Chemical Society want the site blocked. The case isn&#8217;t as straightforward as in other countries, in part because access to Sci-Hub is seen as vital by many local academics.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the Indian High Court declared the case an &#8220;<a href="https://torrentfreak.com/judge-sci-hub-blocking-case-important-for-science-community-representations-will-be-heard-210107/">issue of public importance</a>,&#8221; inviting experts and scientists to testify on the matter. Meanwhile, however, the pressure on Sci-Hub grows. </p>
<h2>Twitter Suspends Sci-Hub Permanently</h2>
<p>This morning, Sci-Hub founder Alexandra Elbakyan informed us that Twitter has <a href="https://twitter.com/sci_hub?lang=en">suspended the site&#8217;s official account</a>, which had over 185k followers and operated without notable issues for nine years. Elbakyan believes that it may be directly related to the legal action in India. </p>
<p>&#8220;It happened right after Indian scientists revolted against Elsevier and other academic publishers after Sci-Hub posted on Twitter about the danger of being blocked &#8211; thousands of people spoke up against this on Twitter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now Twitter said to all of them, SHUT UP!&#8221; Elbakyan adds. </p>
<p><center><strong>One of Sci-Hub&#8217;s Latest Tweets</strong></center><br /><center><img loading="lazy" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/twitter-sci-available.jpg" alt="sci-hub tweet" width="600" height="468" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-199105" /></center></p>
<p>The reason for the suspension is related to Twitter&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/counterfeit-goods-policy#">counterfeit policy</a>.&#8221; The social media platform doesn&#8217;t list any concrete takedown requests but simply mentions the policy violation and the fact that its decision can&#8217;t be appealed. </p>
<p>&#8220;Your account has been permanently suspended due to a violation of Twitter policies, in particular the Counterfeiting Policy. This decision is not subject to appeal,&#8221; Twitter writes, translated from Russian.</p>
<p><center><strong>Twitter&#8217;s email to Sci-Hub</strong></center><br /><center><img loading="lazy" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/twitter-sci-hub.jpg" alt="sci-hub twitter" width="600" height="390" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-199100" /></center></p>
<p>According to Sci-Hub&#8217;s founder, the suspension is an effort to censor her and all those who support the site in its legal battle against the powerful publishers. </p>
<h2>Massive Support From Academics</h2>
<p>Over the past several days, many Indian researchers and academics voiced their support of the site in replies to Sci-Hub&#8217;s tweets. While the tweets from these researchers are still up, they&#8217;re harder to find. And Sci-Hub can no longer call for support either.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now after the Sci-Hub Twitter ban that&#8217;s all gone. Now they can lie and pretend, that there was no support and there will be no easy way to check that!&#8221;</p>
<p>Before the suspension, Elbakyan already started <a href="https://archive.md/QZYln">archiving Sci-Hub&#8217;s tweets</a> and responses. Not just for the historical record but also to use in court, where they will be used as evidence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I collected these responses and forwarded them to my lawyer in India, Nilesh Jain. We were planning to read them aloud in court to prove that Sci-Hub should not be blocked,&#8221; Elbakyan tells us.</p>
<p><center><strong>Some responses, <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/twitter.tweets.pdf">more here</a>, archived by Sci-Hub</strong></center><br /><center><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/research-support.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/research-support.jpg" alt="researchers support sci-hub" width="600" height="443" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-199101" /></a></center></p>
<p>While there are some academics who would prefer to see Sci-Hub gone, the site is supported by researchers all over the world. This is no different in India, where many scholars don&#8217;t have access to expensive subscriptions. </p>
<h2>Damaging Paywalls</h2>
<p>A lot of the top research papers are hidden behind paywalls, which is a continued source of frustration for many.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only reason students from egregiously underfunded institutions in India manage to do quality research is because of platforms like Sci-Hub and Libgen. If you block them, you block research. Period,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/PostitAcademic/status/1340983296163889152">writes</a> Sushmita Pati, Assistant Professor of Political Science.</p>
<p>TorrentFreak reached out to Twitter asking for clarification on their decision to ban the account but the company didn&#8217;t immediately reply. </p>
<h2>Questions Remain, as does Sci-Hub</h2>
<p>As far as we know, Sci-Hub&#8217;s Twitter account didn&#8217;t link directly to infringing content. There were some tweets linking to the Sci-Hub site, but these have been around for a long time. Nothing seems to have changed substantially. </p>
<p>Twitter is known to terminate repeat infringers but Elbakyan notes that this account suspension came out of the blue. At this point, it&#8217;s unclear if Twitter acted on its own or if rightsholders complained. </p>
<p>With Sci-Hub removed from Twitter, the site has lost its presence on the social media platform. However, whether that will do much to stop researchers from accessing the site is doubtful. If recent history has shown anything, it&#8217;s that increased legal pressure on the site only <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/anti-piracy-efforts-are-unlikely-to-beat-sci-hub/">increases its popularity</a>. </p>
