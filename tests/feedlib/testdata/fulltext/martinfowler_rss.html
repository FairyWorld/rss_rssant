<p>A misleading title to draw readers into an occasionally true story</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago Cindy was woken in the wee hours by sounds of
      animals fighting in our garden. As she investigated, she saw two coyotes
      run off, leaving our cat's body behind. A state of nature is a state of
      violence, and our feline predator was quickly turned into prey. Yet our
      garden has high fences all around, making it an unlikely spot for coyotes
      to explore. So is there more to that night than a simple act of
      nature?</p>
